This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input. The `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to fetch a user by ID but fails to handle cases where the ID is invalid or the user is not found. This can lead to application crashes or unexpected responses.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes robust error handling to gracefully manage these scenarios.
